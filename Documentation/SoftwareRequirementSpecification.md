# Software Requirement Specification

## Overview

For this project the agile methodology Extreme Programming will be used.

The system being developed will be a android appolication, this application will be a social fitness app. It will contain features that are seen in most fitness applications, but incorporate some features from soical media applications.

The main high level features that will be implemented:

- Profile: Upon signing up users will be able to create their own customizable profile. Here users will be able to create their own profile where they can give a brief overview about themselves and add in thier own profile picture. Here users will also see their own timeline posts and will be able to share from here.

- Home screen (feed): This feature is that similar to that seen in social media apps, and websites. It will be a feed which will contain recent posts/acitivites that other users have posted. Users will be able to like and comment on these posts/acitivites in their timeline.

- Chat: Provide communcation for users between them and their frieds. This will allow them to have private conversations with other users such as their different workouts or how they are progressing.

## Need for the system and context of its development

The system is being built to help solve the problem of people living sedentary lifestlyes due to social media use, and instead leverage the key features of these apps to encourage users to exercise instead. This is coupled with the increasing rise in social fitness could mean that there could be an increasing demand for the system.

While there are products similar to what is being developed form research none were found to contain all the features that were listed, or have them (word for pushed to users) as much as planned for this application.



## Process used for eliciting requirements

System requirements were elicited by research, online surveys, own opinions, and small focus group.

An online google form was created that asked users what features they would like in an app, and by analysing this data the features were chosen.

## Functional requirements analysis


## Non-functional requirements analysis
