# Final Year Project UP958769

## What is the problem and how am I trying to solve it

- The problem that will be investigated is people living a sedentary lifestyle due to social
media, and not being motivated to exercise, and how certain aspects of social media could
be used to create an application that motivates and encourages people to be more active.

- This is worth working on because in today's world people spend loads of time on social
media living a sedentary lifestyle which has a large impact on societies health. However
social media could be leveraged to instead motivate people to exercise more and live a
more active lifestyle hopefully improving everyone's overall health.

## Project Plan -- Application Domain

#### What system will I be developing?

- I will be developing a social fitness application in Android Studio.

#### Who is the target audience?

- The target audience will be anyone with an android device that is into fitness or would like to get into fitness, and would enjoy the social aspects of social media apps.

### Three layers Required

#### What constitues the storage layer

- The data will be stored in a Firebase database, this is a NoSQL database that is hosted by Google and works well with android studio.

#### What are the main services provided by the system

- Users will be able to create their own profile on the application, as well as share any fitness achievements that have made on their profile.

- They will be able to add friends and chat to them.

- There will be a calorie and water intake tracker, along with a subsection allowing advanced users to track their macro intake. They will also be able to track their weight.

- There will be a categories which will have some exercises and meal prep ideas.

#### What languages/toodl/techonolgies will I be using

- I will be using Java in Anroid Studion.

- Firebase will be used for the storage.

- Picasso will be used to help handle and store images in the application.

- Git will be used for Version Control

#### How will the target audience interact with the system

- The target audience will interact with the system through a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Project plan - Planning

#### What are the project milestones

- Read up on literature regarding my problem and fitness applications.
- Gather user requirements.
- Produce Requirement Specification Document.
- Produce Design Document.
- Code and test application while working on write up.
- Complete final write up.


#### What development model and methodology will I use

- I will be using the Agile Development model, because it will allow me to to break the product development into smell inceremental buils that can be provided in iterations.

- The Agile methodology that I will use will be extreme programming, because it works well for individual work through the approach of start off with simplicity and building up from it. It also will allow for changes in requirements and system functionality which could evolve during the development process.
