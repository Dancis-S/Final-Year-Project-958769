# Final Year Project UP958769

## What is the problem and how am I trying to solve it

- The problem that will be investigated is people living a sedentary lifestyle due to social
media, and not being motivated to exercise, and how certain aspects of social media could
be used to create an application that motivates and encourages people to be more active.

- This is worth working on because in today's world people spend loads of time on social
media living a sedentary lifestyle which has a large impact on societies health. However
social media could be leveraged to instead motivate people to exercise more and live a
more active lifestyle hopefully improving everyone's overall health.
